we were nine or ten\n[00:23.83]Together we've climbed hills and trees\n[00:29.60]Learned of love and ABC's\n[00:32.29]Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees\n[00:34.79]Goodbye my friend it's hard to die\n[00:40.19]When all the birds are singing in the sky\n[00:45.97]Now that spring is in the air\n[00:51.47]Pretty girls are everywhere\n[00:56.87]Think of me and I'll be there\n[00:59.61]We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun\n[01:05.04]But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time\n[01:12.89]Goodbye Papa please pray for me\n[01:18.29]I was the black sheep of the family\n[01:23.82]You tried to teach me right from wrong\n[01:29.61]Too much wine and too much song\n[01:32.37]Wonder how I got along\n[01:34.79]Goodbye Papa it's hard to die\n[01:40.20]When all the birds are singing in the sky\n[01:45.69]Now that the spring is in the air\n[01:51.44]Little children everywhere\n[01:56.83]When you see them I'll be there\n[01:59.63]We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun\n[02:05.09]But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone\n[02:10.59]We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun\n[02:16.04]But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone\n[02:22.60]Yeah yeah\n[02:26.64]Goodbye Michelle my little one\n[02:32.01]You gave me love and helped me find the sun\n[02:37.47]And every time that I was down\n[02:43.24]You would always come around\n[02:45.55]And get my feet back on the ground\n[02:48.40]Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die\n[02:53.82]When all the birds are singing in the sky\n[02:59.24]Now that the spring is in the air\n[03:05.09]With the flowers everywhere\n[03:10.22]I wish that we could both be there\n[03:13.25]We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun\n[03:18.66]But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time\n[03:24.26]We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun\n[03:29.60]But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone\n[03:35.13]We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun\n[03:40.47]But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone\n[03:46.00]We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun\n[03:51.40]But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone\n[03:56.91]We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun\n","tlyric":"[by:\u65e0\u5ff5\u767d]\n[00:12.86]\u518d\u89c1\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u631a\u53cb\n[00:18.45]\u6211\u4eec\u66fe\u5728\u5e74\u5c11\u76f8\u8bc6\n[00:23.83]\u6211\u4eec\u66fe\u7ecf\u4e00\u8d77\u722c\u5c71\u722c\u6811\n[00:29.60]\u7259\u7259\u5b66\u8bed
